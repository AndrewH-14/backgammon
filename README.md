# backgammon
Python modules to play backgammon (human or computer)

## How to run the game

* **Human vs Computer**: run `python single_player.py`
* **Human vs Human**: run `python two_player.py`
* **Computer vs Computer**: run `python main.py` The two 'players' can have different strategies. 
This runs many games with a different 'player' starting each time and returns the probability of the strategies being equally good.
