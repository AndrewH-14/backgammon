# Test 3: Test Against MoveFurthestBackStrategy

This test used the weights that we had preciously calculated against the
CompareAllMovesWeightingDistance strategy and ran them against
the MoveFurthestBackStartegy.

## Conclusion:
ALl the weights performed well against the MoveFurthestBackStrategy, so we
should just focus on the CompareAllMovesWeightingDistance strategy.
